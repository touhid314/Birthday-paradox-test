# Birthday paradox on a virtual test

In probability theory, the birthday problem asks for the probability that, in a set of n randomly chosen people, at least two will share a birthday. The birthday paradox refers to the counterintuitive fact that only 23 people are needed for that probability to exceed 50%.

This program randomly takes 23 babies from the population and sees if their birthdays are same. Upon 10,000 such trials, the probability of two persons sharing same birthday comes out to be 0.9998 when a sample of 75 people is taken. The probability is 0.506 for a sample of 23 persons.
